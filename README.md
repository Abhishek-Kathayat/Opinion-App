# Opinion System

### Introduction
This project "Opinion System" focuses on creating a system to help people give their opinion and discuss about a particular topic of Science, Technology, Politics, Education etc. The App provides the people a platform to give suggestions and raise concerns regarding topics of national and international interests. <br/>
Any user can start a new topic to discuss and others can give their suggestions or raise concerns. <br/>
This project here has been implemented in three parts :<br/>
<ul>
  <li>Front End</li>
  <li>Back End</li>
  <li>Sentimental Analysis</li>
</ul><br/>

### FrontEnd
The Front End part has been implemented as an Android App. The main reason for choosing Android App over other front ends was that Android apps are easily accessible to people, and giving your opinion is just a click away. The Android app also provides the user with the option to rasie a topic other than just giving their opinions.<br/>
Shown below are the screenshots of the app showing the different layout of the app :<br/>
